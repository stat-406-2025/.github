# UBC Stat 406 (2025 W1) GitHub

You do not have access to the UBC STAT 406 course organization.

If you are a student in the course and you are seeing this message:

1. Make sure you have taken `Quiz 0` on Canvas.
2. If you have taken the quiz, make sure you have accepted the invitation to join the GitHub organization sent to your email. (You may have to wait 24 hours after taking the quiz to receive the invitation.)
3. If you have a dropdown on the right that says "View as: Public", click it and select "View as: Member".
4. If all else fails, message the `code-and-github` channel on Slack.
